> #actualization!!! 26/04/18: There was a problem with this species, the area included in the second page of this species was in other proijection , thus areas in this page would be difficult to locate. Bianca has dropped in the new map,  I have changd its maps, so "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/science/phd/dispersal_heterogeneity/datos/DATOS/MAPS/p_tabuliformis_01.img" is the correct now, and "p_tabuliformis_01_error.img" is the ancient with the error.

> #p_sylvestris have two files: p_sylvestris.img and p_sylvestris_michale.img. The difference between them is that the second include area of P. sibirica as P.sylvesitrs, on the contrary of the first file. Because we are considering sibirica as a different species of P. sylvestris, we will use the first file. 
>     #In addition, we have "p_sylvestris_01_sin_siberia.img", a raster of sylvestris distribution without the area of siberia, this raster is wrong, the correct is "p_sylvestris_01.img", and it has been used in all analyses.

[1] should be removed, because it would need a lot of effort to disentangle this species occurrences from Pinus cembroides. Moreover, the status of Pinus discolor is unclear. For some authors it is a distinct species, for some not.
