#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

#we use the shebang "#!/usr/bin/env Rscript" to facilitate portability between machines. "env" offers more portability because it searches for the first occurrence of the R interpreter in the environment where we are running. It should thus look for R version installed in the container

#This is done to have the possibility to run this script as an executable: 'chmod +x myscript.R' and then ' ./myscript.R'. If you run the script as 'R CMD BATCH myscript.R', i THINK this is not used, because it is annotated.

#In case you run this script as an executable, you can save the output without warnings "./myscript.R > myscript.Rout" or with errors "./myscript.R &> myscript.Rout"

They only consider as naturalized those records with clear evidence of self-sustainability and geographical coordinates. This solves a very important limitation compared to just use our GBIF data, as we do not include occurrences like from gardens... This is also a great independent validation, as the data does not come from GBIF, it is completely independent data. Different regions and different data sources.

        ### Optional. Set the job name
        #SBATCH --job-name=global_test_phylo_", names(batch), "
        ### Optional. Set the output filename.
        ### SLURM reads %x as the job name and %j as the job ID
        #SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
        #SBATCH --error=%x-%j.err
        ### Optional. Request email when job begins and ends
        ### SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
        ### Optional. Specify email address to use for notification
        ### SBATCH --mail-user=dftortosa@email.arizona.edu
        ### REQUIRED. Set the partition for your job.
        #SBATCH --partition=albaicin
        ### REQUIRED. Set the number of cores and nodes that will be used for this job. It seems that each node has 56 cores, so you have to adjust accordingly
        #SBATCH --nodes=1
        #SBATCH --ntasks=", length(batch[[1]]), "
        #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=", length(batch[[1]]), "
        ### OPTIONAL. You can set the number of cores per task. This can be useful for scripts in which inside the parallelized process there are other subprocesses. For example, you run 22 independent processes for each chromosome and then you also parallelize the calculations inside each chromosome (https://stackoverflow.com/a/51141287)
        #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
        ### REQUIRED. Set the memory required for this job. I will set 40GC per each of the 100 cores=4000GB; https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Allocation+and+Limits
        ###SBATCH --mem=400gb
        ### REQUIRED. Set the gb per core. YOU HAVE TO SELECT --mem or --mem-per-cpu but NOT BOTH. If you get a .core file, this usually means that the program fails because it asked for too much memory, so it creates a record of the working memory at the time that can be used for debugging. MPI jobs will usually create a core file for each task. You should increase memory limits (https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/memory).
        #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=12gb
        ### set the constraint for high memory nodes in case you use a lot of memory per node. Normal nodes have a 512Gb limit.
        ###SBATCH --constraint=hi_mem
        ### REQUIRED. Specify the time required for this job, hhh:mm:ss
        #SBATCH --time=24:00:00
