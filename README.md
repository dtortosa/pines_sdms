# **Pines SDMs**

This repository includes a novel approach for modelling the edaphoclimatic niche of pines species across the globe, and project the habitat suitability under climate change while considering multiple sources of biological and technical uncertainty. You can see a summary of the steps in the flow chart at the bottom of this README. For further details, check thet published paper in Diversity and Distributions ([link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13849)).
