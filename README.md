# **Novel aproach for Species Distribution Modelling**

This repository includes a novel approach for modelling the edaphoclimatic niche of pines species across the globe, and project the habitat suitability under climate change while considering multiple sources of biological and technical uncertainty. You can see a summary of the steps in the flow chart at the bottom of this README. For further details, check thet published paper in Diversity and Distributions ([link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13849)).

Flowchart summarizing the steps of our analyses. The main analyses, i.e., processing of presence/absence and climate data along with modeling and projection of suitability, are shown in boxes filled with white. The steps of the phylogenetic correction are shown in a separated branch at the right (boxes filled with green). The steps of the independent validation are shown at the bottom (box filled with blue). Abbreviations: RF: Random Forest; GAM: Generalized Additive Model; GLM: Generalized Linear Model; RCPs: Representative Concentration Pathways; GCMs: Global Circulation Models; BIO4: Temperature Seasonality; BIO17: Moisture of the driest quarter; AUC: Area Under Roc Curve; TSS: True Skill Statistics.
