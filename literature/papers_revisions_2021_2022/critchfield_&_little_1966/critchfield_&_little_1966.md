# Geographic distribution of the pines of the world

- Maps of pine across the globe obtained by Critchfield and Little (1966). 

- These maps were scanned and are stored in: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/66393

- HOWEVER, Bianca did its own scanning of the maps and then rasterized. Indeed, the original maps of Bianca lacks for the east part of the distribution of P. sylvestris (we solved in newer versions), but this part is already in this scanned version. In other words, this is not the original source file of our maps, Bianca scan her own physical book.
